Regression Testing:

Test Case Title: Verify Previous Functionality After Code Changes
Test Description: Ensure that previously working functionalities remain intact after making code changes or updates.
Test Steps:
Identify the functionalities affected by the recent code changes.
Execute test cases covering these functionalities.
Compare the current behavior with the expected behavior documented before the changes.
Expected Result: All previously working functionalities should continue to function as expected, with no unintended side effects or regressions.

User Interface Testing:

Test Case Title: Validate UI Elements and Layout
Test Description: Ensure that the user interface elements are correctly displayed and arranged as per design specifications across different screen sizes and resolutions.
Test Steps:
Inspect the UI elements such as buttons, text fields, dropdowns, etc., for correct placement and alignment.
Test UI responsiveness by resizing the browser window or using different devices.
Verify the consistency of UI elements across different pages or screens.
Expected Result: UI elements should be properly aligned, visible, and functional across various screen sizes and resolutions, maintaining consistency in layout and appearance.

Performance Testing:

Test Case Title: Evaluate System Response Time Under Load
Test Description: Assess the system's performance by measuring its response time under different load conditions to ensure it meets performance requirements.
Test Steps:
Simulate a defined number of concurrent users accessing the system.
Measure the system's response time for key actions such as page loading, search queries, or data processing.
Gradually increase the load and observe how the system handles the additional load.
Expected Result: The system should maintain acceptable response times within defined performance thresholds under varying load conditions without experiencing degradation or slowdowns.

Security Testing:

Test Case Title: Validate Authentication Mechanisms
Test Description: Verify the effectiveness of authentication mechanisms and assess the system's vulnerability to common security threats.
Test Steps:
Attempt to login with valid credentials.
Attempt to login with invalid credentials (wrong username/password).
Test for session management by logging in from multiple devices simultaneously.
Expected Result: Valid user credentials should allow successful login, while invalid credentials should trigger appropriate error messages. The system should securely manage user sessions and prevent unauthorized access.

Accessibility Testing:

Test Case Title: Evaluate Accessibility Compliance
Test Description: Assess the application's accessibility features to ensure it meets the needs of users with disabilities and complies with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
Test Steps:
Use accessibility testing tools to evaluate the application for compliance with WCAG guidelines.
Verify that all UI elements are accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers.
Test color contrast ratios and ensure text readability for users with visual impairments.
Expected Result: The application should meet the specified accessibility standards, allowing users with disabilities to navigate and interact with the interface effectively.

Compatibility Testing:

Test Case Title: Verify Cross-Browser Compatibility
Test Description: Ensure that the application functions correctly and displays consistently across different web browsers and versions.
Test Steps:
Access the application using different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Perform basic functionality tests on each browser, including navigation, form submission, and content rendering.
Verify that the layout and design remain consistent across browsers.
Expected Result: The application should behave consistently across all supported browsers, with no significant differences in functionality or appearance.

Localization Testing:

Test Case Title: Validate Multilingual Support
Test Description: Verify that the application's user interface and content are correctly translated and culturally adapted for different locales.
Test Steps:
Switch the application's language settings to different supported languages.
Verify that all UI elements, labels, and content are displayed in the selected language.
Test date formats, currency symbols, and other locale-specific elements for accuracy.
Expected Result: The application should provide a seamless experience for users in different regions, with all content accurately translated and culturally appropriate.
